Quick and simple demo how to read from an SDS011 PM Sensor

The sensor is connected via a serial port, here COM6 on the Netduino 3 Wifi. COM6 is connected to the known D0, D1 of the Netduino headers. The sensor requires a 5 Volt connection, luckily the Netduino has a 5V pin on the power pins of the board.

No further connections are needed.
